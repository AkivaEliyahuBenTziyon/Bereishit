Maimonides - Rambam

Lehot Shuvah - code of repentance

All 10 chapters, sinners repent of sin in front of G-d

Rambam Rules of Repentance Chapter 1 Halacha 1

All Mitzvot, if you transgress, when you do Shuvah, you ave to confess

The source of teshuvah is confession

real means sincere means regret

temple destroyed, no more priests, sacrifce, confession ...

But the Mitzval of confession still applies

100 years later 

Nachmanides = Ramban with a N

commentary on the Chumash ... great halachist & public disputation

In 1263 greatest disputation, published it, exiled in 1265, ends up in Israel

Ramban build the old synagogue

Ramban Deuteronomy Devarim Chapter 30: anticipating the exile

Moses (Moshe rabeinu) : this command is not beyond your reach, not in heaven, not across the sea

The thing i command you today is very near.It is in your mouth and i command to do it.

If you return to G-d, G-d will return to you, and you will physically return to the land and spiritually to the faith.

Ramban command is a command to return to G-d: mitzvah of Teshuvah

Source 3 minute 21 in Devarim 30: 5 times in 3 verses with "shav" (return) root.

RambaM talks about viduit-confession, RambaN talks about shav-return & repentance


2 (two) kinds of religious leaders

- priests - kohen, inherited, rules & time based (bureaucratuc leadership, authority) (no women) (uniformed) (programmable)

- prophets - navi, intrinsic, charisma & intuition based (charismatic leadership, personality) (women allowed) (no uniform) (need intuition and other quality, not AI)

Prophet needs neshama from Hashem, intuition, wisdom, judgement, heart, etc ...

- priest works in bureaucratic time
- prophet works in historical times, cycles of enslaving and liberation, mercy and compassion

Talk of the same, using different vocabulary

Golden Calf

Vayikra 16 --- the scape goat - confessing over it , send it on the wilderness 

Hikvada = confession , technical difference between sins

Kohen analytical & accurate through categories

Attonement (kapparah - erased from record -  attonement) & purification (taharah - mikvah purified - spiritually - cleansing)

Navi approach

Not technical, just talking general terms, word " lashuf " you shall " return ", G-d forgives

Hosea Chapter 14 - return to israel, ,,,, lashuv = return to G-d

navi vs kohen : different vocabularies - it's all what you say and do, thinking abot sins in different ways

kohen thinks about sin essentially as legally specified offense, which is a black mark on record (Google doesn't forget) and deep down it defiles you, you feel tainted , a stain on character, and kapparah & taharah do the job)

navi: after things happen, the relationship has gone wrong, with man or G-d
the issue is personal or G-d relatgionship and coming back to a relationship with forgiveness & love

The only word in common between kohen and navi is: slichah = G-d forbids

Interesting that both navi and kohen use slichah / lesloach

prophet use it in the active tense 

priest kohen use it in the passive form: venislach - it shall be forgiven
Numbers Chapter 15 - venislach - the congregation shall be forgiven

priest is in the temple close to G-d
prophet is in society close to people and relationship

Maimonides Rambam define Shuvah as confession and brining of sacrifice in front of priest and in front of G-d, Shuvah is born in the Temple in the words of the priest

Nachmanides Ramban speakas the words of the prophet: Moses prophetizes that one day Israel will be exiled etc, see G-d in history, physical return to the land, spiritual return to the faith ... may the Temple be rebuilt ... because of your sins exiled physically from your land and exiled spiritually from your G-d and faith

After First Temple was destroyed, Jews exiled to Babylon (byt he water sof babylon we remmember Zion)

babylonian defeated by the Persians

2nd wave of return, the Second temple, gathering by the water gate, read the Torah, renewed the Covenant, this is the historical enactment of Shuvah

That's what Moses according to ramban predicted, and we are living it now

The Golden calf

Moses comes down from Mt Sinai on Yom Kippur on the 10th of Tishrei

What happens if we sion again and there is no Moshe raibenu to negotiate with G-d

Moses said: G-d I need you to be close to the People

A place to meet: the Mikdash

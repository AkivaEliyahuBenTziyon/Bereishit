Maimonides - Rambam

Lehot Shuvah - code of repentance

All 10 chapters, sinners repent of sin in front of G-d

Rambam Rules of Repentance Chapter 1 Halacha 1

All Mitzvot, if you transgress, when you do Shuvah, you ave to confess

The source of teshuvah is confession

real means sincere means regret

temple destroyed, no more priests, sacrifce, confession ...

But the Mitzval of confession still applies

100 years later 

Nachmanides = Ramban with a N

commentary on the Chumash ... great halachist & public disputation

In 1263 greatest disputation, published it, exiled in 1265, ends up in Israel

Ramban build the old synagogue

Ramban Deuteronomy Devarim Chapter 30: anticipating the exile

Moses (Moshe rabeinu) : this command is not beyond your reach, not in heaven, not across the sea

The thing i command you today is very near.It is in your mouth and i command to do it.

If you return to G-d, G-d will return to you, and you will physically return to the land and spiritually to the faith.

Ramban command is a command to return to G-d: mitzvah of Teshuvah

Source 3 minute 21 in Devarim 30: 5 times in 3 verses with "shav" (return) root.

RambaM talks about viduit-confession, RambaN talks about shav-return & repentance


2 (two) kinds of religious leaders

- priests - kohen, inherited, rules & time based (bureaucratuc leadership, authority) (no women) (uniformed) (programmable)

- prophets - navi, intrinsic, charisma & intuition based (charismatic leadership, personality) (women allowed) (no uniform) (need intuition and other quality, not AI)

Prophet needs neshama from Hashem, intuition, wisdom, judgement, heart, etc ...

- priest works in bureaucratic time
- prophet works in historical times, cycles of enslaving and liberation, mercy and compassion

Talk of the same, using different vocabulary

Golden Calf

Vayikra 16 --- the scape goat - confessing over it , send it on the wilderness 

Hikvada = confession , technical difference between sins

Kohen analytical & accurate through categories

Attonement (kapparah - erased from record -  attonement) & purification (taharah - mikvah purified - spiritually - cleansing)

Navi approach

Not technical, just talking general terms, word " lashuf " you shall " return ", G-d forgives

Hosea Chapter 14 - return to israel, ,,,, lashuv = return to G-d

navi vs kohen : different vocabularies - it's all what you say and do, thinking abot sins in different ways

kohen thinks about sin essentially as legally specified offense, which is a black mark on record (Google doesn't forget) and deep down it defiles you, you feel tainted , a stain on character, and kapparah & taharah do the job)

navi: after things happen, the relationship has gone wrong, with man or G-d
the issue is personal or G-d relatgionship and coming back to a relationship with forgiveness & love

The only word in common between kohen and navi is: slichah = G-d forbids

Interesting that both navi and kohen use slichah / lesloach

prophet use it in the active tense 

priest kohen use it in the passive form: venislach - it shall be forgiven
Numbers Chapter 15 - venislach - the congregation shall be forgiven

priest is in the temple close to G-d
prophet is in society close to people and relationship

Maimonides Rambam define Shuvah as confession and brining of sacrifice in front of priest and in front of G-d, Shuvah is born in the Temple in the words of the priest

Nachmanides Ramban speakas the words of the prophet: Moses prophetizes that one day Israel will be exiled etc, see G-d in history, physical return to the land, spiritual return to the faith ... may the Temple be rebuilt ... because of your sins exiled physically from your land and exiled spiritually from your G-d and faith

After First Temple was destroyed, Jews exiled to Babylon (byt he water sof babylon we remmember Zion)

babylonian defeated by the Persians

2nd wave of return, the Second temple, gathering by the water gate, read the Torah, renewed the Covenant, this is the historical enactment of Shuvah

That's what Moses according to ramban predicted, and we are living it now

The Golden calf

Moses comes down from Mt Sinai on Yom Kippur on the 10th of Tishrei

What happens if we sion again and there is no Moshe raibenu to negotiate with G-d

Moses said: G-d I need you to be close to the People

A place to meet: the Mikdash

A religious leader who will always be there: kohen & leader kohen gadol

Yom Kippur will be the day when the priest wins attonement for the people

G-d takes religious leadership from charismatic to bureaucratic

Max Weber: the routinization of charisma ...

How do you take peak experience and translate them in daily doen to earth experiences

Which is why Shuvah has the entirely different elements

Duality of priest and prophets- but then the land, the temple, the priests, the prophets are gone

No subsequent prophets after the Second Temple period

What do the Rabbi do

Everything single Jew has to become a priest and a prophet

Yom ha kippurim - apriestly world

But the prophet spoke lashuv - the period is haseret yumje teshuvah

we do the vidui but it has two different forms

the other form is ahoret - sins between humans - relationship is the concern of the prophet

priestly vs prophetic confession

Haftorah for Yom Kippur Isahiah Chapter 58 ... share you food with the hungry

Minchah reading: Jonah, sent to the gentiles - Syrian

Jonah says 5 words and immediately everyone does Shuvah

Into the most priestly of days are introduced strong prophetic acts

Two roles are being brought together: as a priest and as a prophet, mend the relationship with G-d and with human beings

Slichot: derives from the time Moses prayed to hashem for the sin of the Golden Calf

G-d said : salachti ... slichot prophetic voice

shavnu begavnu ... priestly voice

what empowered the Rabbis to do that?

Took it as a means to democratize holiness

Because the rabbis listened and heard 2 sentences

Shemot chapter 19 verse 6: Moses propose a deal to people

mamlachet kohanim ve goy kadosh - a kingdom of priest and a holy nation

When Moses was having a bad day - Shemot Chaper 11: 70 elders and the 2 elders left out Eldad and Medad

Then Josuah said to Moses shut them up

Moses: are you jealous on my behalf? Would they all G-d people be prophet?

The rabbi found the moment to fullfil the prophecy in the period betwween that Temple destructions and the Holocaust 

rabbi democraticized and elevated everyone to a priest securing attonement and a prophet mending broken relationship

Everyone says slichot

A Sage can sometimes be even greater than a prophet

The Sages tried to preserve the element of Judaism and elevated it

Bottom line ; G-d created the Universe for love and forgiveness. More than we have faith in G-d, G-d has faith in us.

Never lose faith in the faith of G-d in us, may we all have the privilege of returning to G-d and have G-d return to us.
